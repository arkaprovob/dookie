This is extended dookie added support for some custom requirements

Dookie lets you write MongoDB test fixtures in JSON or
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) with extra syntactic sugar
(extended JSON, variables, imports, inheritance, etc.).

**Note:** Dookie requires Node >= 4.0.0. Dookie is **not** tested with nor
expected to work with Node 0.x or io.js.
